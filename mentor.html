            HackGT 7: Mentorship
        </div>
        <p>
            We are super excited that you are interested in being a mentor at HackGT 7! Mentors are 
            an integral part of the hackathon experience for helping participants learn and create their projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to continue building the hackathon community, we want to actively support students who are new 
            to computer science or hackathons. This year we have created a track called <strong>Emerging Hackers</strong>, who are 
            participants with introductory level experience in computer science but have little project experience or 
            who are diving into their very first coding project. This is separate from the General Hackers, which consists 
            of intermediate and advanced participants. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Hackathons can be intimidating for Emerging hackers, so part of making their hackathon experience a success is 
            having regular support from someone to help answer questions and guide them through (for most) their first 
            hackathon project. This is what drives our mentorship program this year.
        </p>
        <div class="header small">
            Mentors for Emerging Hacker Teams
        </div>
        <p>
            We have created the Emerging Hacker Mentorship program, which is made so Emerging hacker teams (teams with 
            majority emerging hackers) can have a designated mentor to help guide them through the hackathon. If you 
            join this program, you will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Be matched to 1-2 emerging hacker teams based on their goals and your expertise at the beginning of the event
            </li>
            <li>
                Check-in with team at least once each day of the hackathon (3 meetings)
            </li>
            <li>
                Answer questions and give advice to your assigned team, such as technical questions and assisting with their 
                devpost submissions and presentations. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In addition to helping your teams, you still have the opportunity to help other general hackers! <strong>This 
                is an optional program. If you are interested in being a mentor for an Emerging Hacker team, let us know 
                in the Mentorship Application.</strong> Once accepted and confirmed, we will provide you with more information 
                and resources about how you can support your team. 
        </p>
        <div class="header small">
            Mentors for All Hackers
        </div>
        <p>
            If you are not interested in this Emerging Hacker Mentorship Program, thatâ€™s okay! You can still be an 
            important part of the overall hacker experience as an Overall Mentor. Overall Mentors are available for all 
            hackers, especially the larger pool of General Hackers at the event through answering questions, debugging, 
            and explaining topics to teams that request help. 
        </p>
        <div class="header">
            Overall Expectations
        </div>
        <p>
            We <strong>do not</strong> expect you to be available for all hours of the event. Once you have confirmed that 
            you will mentor at HackGT 7, you can let us know at what times you plan to be available. In order for HackGT 7 
            mentors to support the participants throughout the virtual hackathon, all mentors, in the Emerging Hacker Program 
            or not, are expected to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Be available online for 4-8 hours during the event to support the participants through answering questions 
                or helping at workshops
            </li>
            <li>
                Be proactive and responsive to questions from participants using our Mentorship questions tool
            </li>
            <li>
                Attend a 1-2 hour mentor training session prior to the event where we will show you how to use our tools 
                and resources
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            While you offer your knowledge, as an attendee you will also have access to sponsors, workshops, mini-events, 
            speakers, and of course, free swag!
        </p>
